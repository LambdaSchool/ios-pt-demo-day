## Questions (Answer indented below)

1. What was your favorite feature to implement? Why?

My favorite feature for Water My Plant was probably the theme helper. Getting to play with images, gradients, and how the text looked on those fields was fun. There is a fine line between what looks "cool" and what is audience appropriate and user freindly. 

2. What was your #1 obstacle or bug that you fixed? How did you fix it?

Trying to get out detailVC to updated the "Plant" was tough. It alway ends up being a few small errors that hold you back. But we tracked them down one by one to get it to work. Lesson of the day, ALWAY CHECK YOUR OUTLETS.
  
3. Share a chunk of code (or file) you're proud of and explain why.

This bit of code if fairly straight forward, but took me forever to figure out. I really wanted to add the notification, since the whole idea of the app is to remind people to water their plant. This notification asks once for permission to send notification to the phone. Once the "Needs water" button is tapped, it is set up on a 15 second timer to send a notification. Obviousely this is not user friendly in a purposeful manner, but eventually I would like to have it set up on a timer linked to the input the user specifies on the add plant page.
  
4. What is your elevator pitch? (30 second description your Grandma or a 5-year old would understand)

This app will allow you to keep track of your plants needs, location, and status. We all have busy lives, so it will also remind you when that specific plant is due to be watered again. You have the ability to edit your plants needs as well if you are finding what was originally entered does not work for this plant. 
  
5. What is your #1 feature?

I think the number one feature is the notification that is sent to the users phone to remind them to water their plant. It is the whole purpose of this app to take the stress of remembering to water the plants off the user, and remind them when they need to do so. 
  
6. What are you future goals?

I would ultimately like to have the timer (when the button is tapped) linked to a user input that would have to take specific values, maybe a pickerview for daily, weekly, ect. Then of course of the notification notify the user based off those values. 

## Required Slides (Add your Keynote to your PR)

1. App Name / Team Slide
2. Elevator Pitch
3. Your #1 Feature (Customer facing — what can I do with your app?)
4. Future Goals

## Slide Requirements

1. 50 pt font minimum
2. Be concise — don't write sentences/paragraphs (put these in your slide notes for speaking)
3. 3-6 bullets maximum per slide
4. Do the squint test (can you read the text if you squint, if so, make the font bigger)
6. Images are always welcome
7. Do the Grandma Test (Would your Grandma understand you?)

### Optional Slides

1. Blooper: What's a funny bug or blooper? (screenshots/GIFs please)
2. Revenue Model: If the app was your sole source of income, how would you monetize it?

## Presentation Format

**7 minutes/team**

* 4 minute presentation (5 minute hard cap)
* 3 minutes of questions

We have ~12 teams presenting today — please practice your presentation with a timer (as a team), and make sure you fit within the time limit.

Plan on having one person present the slides and live demo. Please practice your presentation in front of a mirror or with your team 2-5 times. Have the app running and visible (Simulator or QuickTime) so you can quickly transition between slides and live demo.

* App Name / Team Slide (30 seconds)
* Elevator Pitch Slide (30 seconds)
* Your #1 Feature (30 seconds)
* Live Demo (2 minutes)
* Future Goals (30 seconds)
* Questions (3 minutes)
