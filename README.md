## Questions (Answer indented below)

1. What was your favorite feature to implement? Why?

`The theme helper has always been one of my favorites, because it gives a user the option to customize their experience. I'm also in love with the notification feature that Breena completed.`

2. What was your #1 obstacle or bug that you fixed? How did you fix it?

`The detail view controller was confusing and we couldn't figure out why it wasn't loading information. It came down to the outlets. Which will now be one of the first things I check when debugging.`
  
3. Share a chunk of code (or file) you're proud of and explain why.

`I completed the "PlantController.swift file, and it was challenging but very rewarding. The persist is most likely what I'm proudest of because that was integral to the success of our app.`
  
4. What is your elevator pitch? (30 second description your Grandma or a 5-year old would understand)

`Our app will let you create virtual files your plants, including details on how to take care of the plant like how much water and sunlight the plant needs, as well as if it should be an indoor or outdoor plant. It will give you reminders that you need to water your plants based on how frequently you stated the plant should be watered. You will never forget to water your plants again! Our app also allows you to customize your experience by changing the background color of the app. You can also add pictures of your leafy friends and edit things about them if you decide to change their routine.`
  
5. What is your #1 feature?

`The notification is absolutely our number one feature. It's the reason that we created the app. An app that would remind a user to water their plants. Without that feature, the app would be no more than a file cabinet of plant information.`
  
6. What are you future goals?

`We would like the app to automatically send alerts on a regular basis without the user needing to push a button. They would still press the button in order for the app to recognize that the plant was watered, but it would remind them on a daily, weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly basis based on the input from a pickerView the user has access to.`
